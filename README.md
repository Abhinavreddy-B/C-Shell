# What is This?
* This is a Shell written in C for Linux operating system.

# Why write a new one when you have Bash?
* lol this is part of an assignment at college

# How to Install?
* I wouldn't recommend anyone installing it. ðŸ˜‚
* Go use bash instead of this.

# If you really Want to use this as a reference for your shell assignment:
* My `Ctrl+Z`,`Ctrl+C` are Not working properly.
* Go to the folder you wish, And Run:
    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/Abhinavreddy-B/C-Shell.git
    ```
* Compile as:
    ```sh
    $ make
    (or)
    $ make main
    ```
* Run As:
    ```sh
    $ ./main
    ```
* How To Exit?
    * I am not a VIM user, I provide a way to exit my Shell.
    * just press `Ctrl+D`

# Assignment 3
 > assuming precendence order is `';'`>`'&'`>`'|'` > (spaces and tabs) > (io redirection) . So tokenising accordingly.

1. Spec1:
    * Assuming that `<` , `>` , `>>` would always be followed by a file name ( i.e commands like "`cat < >`" or "`cat <`" will give ambiguous results)
2. Spec2:
    * the commands when using pipe run one command after the other 
        ```
        ~> sleep 5 | sleep 5
        ```
        takes 10 seconds to execute.
3. Spec4:
    * `bg` is having problems with "vi" / "vim" due to some unknown vi bugs.
4. Spec6:
    * Everything is implemented as mentioned in the PDF
    
# Assignment 2
## assumptions:
 > assumed all lengths such as  `Maximum input size`,`Maximum directory path length`,.... to be 1001

 > assuming precendence order is `';'`>`'&'`>(spaces and tabs) . So tokenising accordingly.

 > Please use a terminal window of sufficient width so that text wrat does not cause any problem
 
1. cd:
    * Not handling `~` when `~` is not at the start of the path (similar to bash).
    * maximum length of paths is `1001` chars
2. echo:
    * printed as is irrespective of  Quotes and newlines ( `"`,`\n`,`'`).
    * handled space and '`\t`' characters similar to bash ( replace multiple space / tabs with single space ).
3. pwd:
    * Did not check for the number of arguments passed ( since bash also does the same ).
    * `absolute path`
4. ls:
    * implemented same as that of Bash.
    * assumed that there cant be paths like `/` , where there are some special files / folders which are not handlable.
    * if there are multiple files / folders as arguments , we printed in the same order as given to us ( Bash prints for files first and directories next ).
    * if the user name , or group name exceeds 15 characters , only the first 15 chars of their name are printed.
5. pinfo:
    * cannot read the executable path for certain processes like `systemd` ( pid - 1 ) , where user does not have appropriate permissions.
6. History:
    * even if the input has only a combination of spaces and tabs , they are being added to history.
    * even if input is an invalid command it is being added to history.
    * refraing from adding to history only when the new input is exact same as old one (including space / tabs ).
    * saving history in a hidden file `.shell_history.tmp`. any arbitrary changes made to this file while programme execution would not reflect and leads to unexpected errors.
8. Background commands:
    * running `vi`/`vim` as a background process is creating problems due to some issues with inputs (stdin) on some machines. All other external commands work perfectly.
9. Foreground processes:
    * The time taken printed is the sum of individual parts of  command
     ```
     sleep 3 ; sleep 4
     would print the time taken as 7s
     ```
